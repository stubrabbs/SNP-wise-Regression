Finished full algorithm is located in the "Algorithm" folder. Earlier work is in the "Preliminary" and "Weights" folders. Useful functions are in the 
r file "snpwise_functions.R"

Note that there is a potential redundancy issue in the algorithm - algorithm may count the same model multiple times and inflate PIPs.
