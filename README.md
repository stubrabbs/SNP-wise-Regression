# SNP-wise-Regression

This repository contains files relating to the investigation of a "SNP-wise" regression algorithm, as well as experiments with the Sum of Single Effects (SuSiE) algorithm. Files are included as RMarkdowns and pdfs.

Files pertaining directly to the SNP-wise regression are in the folder "SNP-wise." An updated procedure for finding weights for a dataset with p parameters is in the "Weights" folder, titled "SNP-wise General Weights 2.0". The multivariate log Bayes Factor function is in this file as well. 

Files pertaining to SuSiE are in the "SuSiE" folder.

Other paper summaries and experiments, including on the horseshoe prior, are in the "Other" folder.
